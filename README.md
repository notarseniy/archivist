## Archivist revisited

*After one and half years of project existence we've decided to push it forward and rewrite the codebase.
Archivist is facing transformation to a library for building publishing toolsets rather than predefined system. Still we like to think of Archivist as kind of missing link between digital documents and data. It is a key feature of project. We just want to make it more flexible.*

Key features of upcoming release:
- New [Substance](https://github.com/substance/substance) core
- Substance Components instead of React.js and backbone (faster render time, less dependencies)
- Realtime collaboration instead of old locking system
- PostgreSQL instead of MongoDB and ElasticSearch (Yes, you will be able to run whole system on a small virtual server)

If you have any ideas how to improve project, you want to share your vision please feel free to [open issue](https://github.com/archivist/archivist/issues/new) or [contact maintainer directly](mailto:beilinson@gmail.com). We love feedback.

Archivist is open source project released under the GPL license. If you want to help project you can fund its development and maintenance.

Archivist is a full-stack publishing solution involving different technologies to power digital archives.
Archivist originally has been developed for the [Memorial International Society](http://memorial.de/index.php?id=18) to publish interviews of Ost-Arbeiters and WWII prisoners. They are published as full transcriptions (in russian) complete with multimedia sources (audio, video). Editors are able to tag and link subjects, locations, persons and definitions in the text, so that the archive can be queried later in interesting ways. Researchers are able to perform a full-text search, but also filter interviews by related subjects and external entities.
